Data
=========================


Access to the disdrometer measurements and metadata is available through a separate Github repository : `disdrodb-data <https://github.com/ltelab/disdrodb-data>`__.


The `disdrodb-data` GitHub repository includes:

- The stations measurements in the form of a JSON file with URLs links to the downloadable data (not included in the repository due to GitHub's file size limitation).
- The stations metadata in YAML file format.
- The stations issue in YAML file format.
- Some python code to download the datasets using the URLs provided in the JSON files.
- Some python code to curate the metadata archive.
