Access to the disdrometer measurement datasets is available through a separate Github repository : `disdrodb-data <https://github.com/ltelab/disdrodb-data>`__.


This GitHub repository includes the following information:

- Stations measurements in the form of a JSON file with links to the downloadable data (not included in the repository due to GitHub's file size limitation).
- Stations metadata in YAML files.
- Stations issues in YAML files.
- Python code to download the datasets using the URLs provided in the JSON files.
