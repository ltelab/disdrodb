Installation
=========================


We define here two types of installation :

- `Installation for standard users`_ : for users who want to process data.

- `Installation for contributors`_: for contributors who want to enrich the project (eg. add a new reader).

We recommend users and contributors to use a `Virtual environment`_ to install DISDRODB.


Installation for standard users
==================================

Pip-based installation
..............................

disdrodb is available from the `Python Packaging Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`__ as follow:


.. code-block:: bash

   pip install disdrodb






Installation for contributors
================================


The latest disdrodb stable version is available on the GitHub repository `disdrodb <https://github.com/ltelab/disdrodb>`_.

Clone the repository from GitHub
.........................................

According to the `contributors guidelines <contributors_guidelines>`__, you should first create a fork into your personal GitHub account.

* Install a local copy of the forked repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/disdrodb.git
    cd disdrodb






Install the DISDRODB package dependencies
............................................

You can use either pip or conda: 


* **Pip**

	.. code-block:: bash

	   pip install -r requirements.txt
	


	
* **Conda**

	Create the `disdrodb-dev` conda environment and install the required dependencies:

	.. code-block:: bash

		conda env update -f environment.yml 


To install the project in editable mode : 
	
.. code-block:: bash
		
	pip install -e .




Install pre-commit code quality checking
..............................................

After setting up your development environment, install the git
pre-commit hook by executing the following command in the repository’s
root:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pre-commit 
   pre-commit install
   

The pre-commit hooks are scripts executed automatically in every commit
to identify simple code quality issues. When an issue is identified
(the pre-commit script exits with non-zero status), the hook aborts the
commit and prints the error. Currently, DISDRODB tests that the
code to be committed complies with `black’s  <https://github.com/psf/black>`__ format style
and the `ruff <https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff>`__ linter.

In case that the commit is aborted, you only need to run `black`and `ruff` through your code.
This can be done by running ``black .`` and ``ruff check .`` or alternatively with ``pre-commit run --all-files``. 
The latter is recommended since it indicates if the commit contained any formatting errors (that are automatically corrected).

.. note::
	To maintain consitency, we use Black version `22.8.0` (as defined into `.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Make sure to stick to version.  



Virtual environment
==================================

While not mandatory, utilizing a virtual environment when installing DISDRODB is recommended. Using a virtual environment for installing packages provides isolation of dependencies, easier package management, easier maintenance, improved security, and improved development workflow.



To set up a virtual environment, follow these steps :

* **With venv :**  

	* Windows: Create a virtual environment with venv:

		.. code-block:: bash

		   python -m venv disdrodb-dev
		   cd disdrodb-dev/Scripts
		   activate
		   

	* Mac/Linux: Create a virtual environment with venv:

		.. code-block:: bash

		   virtualenv -p python3 disdrodb-dev
		   source disdrodb-dev/bin/activate



* **With conda:**

	* Create the `disdrodb-dev` (or anay other name) conda environment:

		.. code-block:: bash

			conda create --name disdrodb-dev python=3.9 --no-default-packages

	* Activate the disdrodb conda environment:

		.. code-block:: bash

			conda activate disdrodb-dev


Run DISDRODB on Jupyter Notebooks
==================================	

If you want to run disdrodb on a `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__, 
you have to take care to set up the IPython kernel environment where disdrodb is installed.

For example, if your conda/virtual environment is named `disdrodb-dev`, run:

.. code-block:: bash 

    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=disdrodb-dev

When you will use the Jupyter Notebook, by clicking on `Kernel` and then `Change Kernel`, you will be able to select the `disdrodb-dev` kernel.
