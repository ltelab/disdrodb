DISDRODB is part of an initial effort to index, collect and homogenize drop size distribution (DSD) data sets across the globe,
as well as to establish a global standard for disdrometers observations data sharing.
DISDRODB standards are being established following FAIR data best practices and Climate & Forecast (CF) conventions, and will facilitate the preprocessing, analysis and visualization of disdrometer data.

The DISDRODB archive is composed of 3 product levels:
- L0 provides the raw sensors measurements converted into a standardized netCDF4 format.
- L1 provides L0 homogenized and quality-checked data.
- L2 provides scientific products derived from the L1 data.

The code required to the generate the DISDRODB archive is enclosed in the `production` directory of the repository.

The code facilitating the analysis and visualization of the DISDRODB archive is available in the `api` directory.


The software documentation is available at [https://disdrodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://disdrodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Currently:
- only the DISDRODB L0 product generation has been implemented;
- the pipeline for DISDRODB L1 and L2 product generation is in development;
- the DISDRODB API is in development;
- more than 300 sensors have been already processed to DISDRODB L0;
- tens of institutions have manifested their interest in adopting the DISDRODB tools and standards.

Consequently **IT IS TIME TO GET INVOLVED**. If you have ideas, algorithms, data or expertise to share, do not hesitate to **GET IN TOUCH** !!!




## Installation


DISDRODB can be installed from PyPI with pip:
